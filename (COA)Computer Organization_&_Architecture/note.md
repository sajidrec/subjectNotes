# Computer Architecture

Definition : It is the design of computers, including their instruction sets, hardware components and system organization.  

Architecture -> i) Instructions Set Architecture (ISA)  
                ii) Hardware System Architecture (HSA)  

Computer Architecture -> i) Von Neumann Architecture  
                        ii) Non-Von Neumann Architecture

In Harvard Architecture we have separate memory unites, This way way processor can both read data instruction and perform data memory access at same time

Memory is the faculty of the brain by which data or information is encoded, stored, and retrieved when needed.  

Primary memory is the computer's main memory and stores data temporarily.  
Secondary memory is external memory and saves data permanently.

D.R.A.M. = Dynamic Random Access Memory  
Each DRAM memory cell is made up of a transistor and a capacitor within an integrated circuit, and a data bit is stored in the capacitor.  

S.R.A.M. = Static Random Access Memroy (Cache)  
Static RAM (SRAM) consists of flip-flops, a bistable circuit composed of four to six transistors. Once a flip-flop stores a bit, it keeps that value until the opposite value is stored in it. SRAM gives fast access to data
